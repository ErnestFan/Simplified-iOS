# Building Project for interview

**Note:** This configuration is not currently supported. In the interim, you _should_ be able to get it to build via the following steps:

01. `git clone https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git` or `git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git`
02. `cd Simplified-iOS`
03. `git submodule deinit adept-ios && git rm -rf adept-ios`
04. `git submodule deinit adobe-content-filter && git rm -rf adobe-content-filter`
05. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
06. Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) if you haven't already.
07. Remove "NYPL-Simplified/NYPLAEToolkit" and "AudioEngine.json" in `Cartfile` and `Cartfile.resolved`.
08. `carthage bootstrap --platform ios --use-ssh`
09. `cp APIKeys.swift.example Simplified/APIKeys.swift` and edit accordingly.
10. `cp Accounts.json.example Simplified/Accounts.json`.
11. `(cd readium-sdk; sh MakeHeaders.sh Apple)` (parentheses included) to generate the headers for Readium.
12. `open Simplified.xcodeproj`
13. Remove import of "Simplified+RMSDK.xcconfig" from "Simplified.xcconfig".
14. Delete `NYPLAEToolkit.framework` and `AudioEngine.framework` from "Link Binary with Libraries", and remove input and output filepaths for `AudioEngine.framework` and `NYPLAEToolkit.framework` from `Copy Frameworks (Carthage)`.
15. Note: For now, we recommend keeping any unstaged changes as a single git stash until better dynamic build support is added.
16. Build.

# Contributing

This codebase follows [Google's Objective-C Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.xml)
including the use of two-space indentation. Both Objective-C and Swift may be
used for new code.

The primary services/singletons within the program are as follows:

* `NYPLAccount`
* `NYPLBookCoverRegistry` (used directly only by `NYPLBookRegistry`)
* `NYPLBookRegistry`
* `NYPLConfiguration`
* `NYPLKeychain`
* `NYPLMyBooksDownloadCenter`
* `NYPLMigrationManager`

All of the above contain appropriate documentation in the header files.

The rest of the program follows Apple's usual pattern of passive views,
relatively passive models, and one-off controllers for integrating everything.
Immutability is preferred wherever possible.

Questions, suggestions, and general discussion occurs via Slack: Email
`swans062@umn.edu` for access.
